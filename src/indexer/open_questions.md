how will the frontend/analytics know about current "tip" (highest blocks without the gaps)

should indexes used for analytics be created in the indexing or rather in the analytics?
- I think it would be more maintanable and performant if "indexing team" creates indexes, and if analytics need it they can always ask for it, this will make a process a bit longer but more robust
